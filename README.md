# Bennett's WebPage
An Angular web page to show off some off some of my hobbies and programming projects I have worked on. The webpage can be found at www.dbballentine.com

## Serve
To view the web page locally, run `ng serve`. The Angular Framework needs to be installed for this to work. For more information on installing Angular, visit https://angular.io/docs

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
